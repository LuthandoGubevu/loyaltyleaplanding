## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant coral (#E26C5E) to highlight the inviting aspects of community, reward and relationship. Chosen because it evokes warmth, friendliness, and is also eye-catching, while also not using the color teal.
- Background color: Light peach (#FFF4EF), a desaturated version of the primary to complement without overpowering.
- Accent color: Slate purple (#4A4C79), an analogous color to the primary, with contrast.
- Clean, modern font for headlines and body text, focusing on readability and a friendly feel.
- Soft-edged, visually consistent icons that align with the warm color scheme.
- Mobile-first design with a clean and modern layout, ensuring a user-friendly experience on all devices.
- Subtle animations on hover for interactive elements, such as feature cards, to enhance user engagement.
